title: Validated Objects
---

Arbitrary POJO (plain old objects) can be validated. Fzzy Config will automatically wrap any object that implements `Walkable`, or you can construct validation with `ValidatedAny`. The validation builds a "mini-config" around the object; anything included within the object will be validated just like a config. [Annotations](../Annotations) relevant to configs like `@IgnoreVisibility` work for these objects also.

<Callout variant="warning">
An object used in this way needs an empty constructor (doesn't have to be the only constructor, one of them should be empty). It's not _strictly_ necessary in the "game crashes" sense, but it will avoid niche issues that pop up when displaying the object in-game.

See examples of `ValidatedAny` at [Laying out Configs](../../config-design/Laying-out-Configs)
