Arbitrary POJO (plain ol' objects) can be validated. Fzzy Config will automatically wrap any object that implements `Walkable`, or you can construct validation manually with `ValidatedAny`. The validation constructs a "mini-config" around the object; any validation or applicable fields included within the object will be validated just like a proper config. [[Annotations]] relevant to configs like `@IgnoreVisibility` work for these objects also.

<Callout variant="warning">
An object used in this way should have an empty constructor (doesn't have to be the only constructor, one of them should be empty). It's not _strictly_ necessary, but it will help avoid niche issues that might pop up when displaying the object in-game.
</Callout>

See examples of `ValidatedAny` at [Laying out Configs](../../config-design/Laying-out-Configs)
