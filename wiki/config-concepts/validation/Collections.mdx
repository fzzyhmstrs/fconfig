title: Validated Collections
---

Fzzy Config has validation tools for lists, maps, and sets. Each of these constructs has builders and other intricacies that are best digested thoroughly by visiting the documentation:

[Validated Collections](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.validation.collection/index.html)

<Callout variant="info">
Validated collections implement their respective collection type (list, set, map), so can be used directly as such instead of having to <code>.get()</code> the wrapped collection first.
</Callout>

### Validation Conversion
Any `ValidatedField` can be converted into a list or set implementation with it as backing validation using the `toList()` and `toSet()` methods, respectively. In addition, collections can be converted to [ValidatedChoice](Choices) using their `toChoices()` method

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
//wraps the vararg valued provided with a blank validated field (identifiers in this case). validation with actual bounds and logic can of course be used too
public ValidatedList<Identifier> listFromField = new ValidatedIdentifier().toList(Identifier.of("stick"), Identifier.of("blaze_rod"));
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
//wraps the vararg valued provided with a blank validated field (identifiers in this case). validation with actual bounds and logic can of course be used too
var listFromField = ValidatedIdentifier().toList(Identifier.of("stick"), Identifier.of("blaze_rod"))
```

</CodeTabs>

### Static Initializers
ValidatedList and Set have a series of static methods that can be used to initialize a variety of collections of given common types, much in the same vein as the java `List.of()` or kotlin `listOf()`.

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
public ValidatedList<Integer> validatedIntList = ValidatedList.ofInt(1, 2, 5, 10);
public ValidatedSet<Integer> validatedIntSet = ValidatedSet.ofInt(1, 2, 5, 10);
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
var validatedIntList = ValidatedList.ofInt(1, 2, 5, 10)
var validatedIntSet = ValidatedSet.ofInt(1, 2, 5, 10)
```
