title: Validated Choice Lists

Added in Fzzy Config 0.6.0

Create sets of selectable and de-selectable choices with `ValidatedChoiceList`. This is useful for a feature-flag-style setting, polling for active flags using `List#contains`.

Like `ValidatedChoice`, this validation is of the type `List<T>`, where T is your choice type. Like `ValidatedList`, this validation implements the `List` interface, so can be used directly for list operations.

Helper methods `toChoiceList` in `ValidatedList / Set / Choice` make creation of a choice list easier

```java !!tabs Java
ValidatedChoiceList<String> enabledFeatures = ValidatedList.ofString("dev_mode", "logging", "fail_fast", "compatibility_mode").toChoiceList(listOf("logging"));
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
val enabledFeatures = ValidatedList.ofString("dev_mode", "logging", "fail_fast", "compatibility_mode").toChoiceList(listOf("logging"))
```

The choice list appears in-GUI as a popup with the available choices, each in an enabled or disabled state. Clicking on any choice flip it's state between enabled and disabled.
