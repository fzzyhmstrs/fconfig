title: Validated Pairs
---

<Callout>
Added in Fzzy Config 0.6.0
</Callout>

Validation can be joined into pairs, which are then stored as one `ValidatedPair.Tuple`. This allows you to present two Validations as one "setting", that the user understands are part of the same "unit" of functionality. For example:
* An allowable range with a max and min. Join these together to create one Range setting that has both the max and min selectors side by side.
* An on-off switch and then an Object/`ValidatedAny` setting with a condition on the on-off switch being on, allowing you to have a "confirmation gate" where the user first has to enable the fancy/dangerous/special settings before they can interact with them.

Other features:
* Pairs can have custom labels added to better illustrate what each half of the pair is accomplishing. "Min" and "Max" for the above range example, perhaps.
* Pair elements can also be stacked on top of each other. See the constructor method below using `ValidatedPair.LayoutStyle.STACKED`.

```java !!tabs Java
//Validated field has a mapping method 'pairWith' that automatically applies the default values of each half into the Pairs default value
public ValidatedPair<Int, Int> pair1 = (new ValidatedInt(1, 10, 0)).pairWith(new ValidatedInt(10, 20, 10));

//you can still do it the other way if you want. This also lets you stack the two settings on top of each other if desired.
public ValidatedPair<Int, Int> pair1Long = new ValidatedPair(new ValidatedPair.Tuple(1, 10), new ValidatedInt(1, 10, 0), new ValidatedInt(10, 20, 10), ValidatedPair.LayoutStyle.STACKED);

//if both halves are the same validation type, there is a shorthand static method. You can define the default tuple and layout style optionally.
public ValidatedPair<Int, Int> pairSame = ValidatedPair.of(new ValidatedInt(1));

//if both halves are the same validation type, there is a shorthand static method. You can define the default tuple and layout style optionally.
public ValidatedPair<Int, Int> pairSameLabeled = ValidatedPair.withLabels(ValidatedPair.of(new ValidatedInt(1)), LeftText, RightText);

//Pairs store their value in a nested class `Tuple`. To retrieve your setting you would do something like
int pairMin = pair1.get().left;
int pairMax = pair1.get().right;
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
//Validated field has a mapping method 'pairWith' that automatically applies the default values of each half into the Pairs default value
val pair1 = ValidatedInt(1, 10, 0).pairWith(ValidatedInt(10, 20, 10))

//you can still do it the other way if you want. This also lets you stack the two settings on top of each other if desired.
val pair1Long = ValidatedPair(ValidatedPair.Tuple(1, 10), ValidatedInt(1, 10, 0), ValidatedInt(10, 20, 10), ValidatedPair.LayoutStyle.STACKED)

//if both halves are the same validation type, there is a shorthand static method. You can define the default tuple and layout style optionally.
val pairSame = ValidatedPair.of(ValidatedInt(1))

//Add labels with the withLabels extension function
val pairSameLabeled = ValidatedPair.of(ValidatedInt(1)).withLabels(LeftText, RightText)

//Pairs store their value in a nested class `Tuple`. To retrieve your setting you would do something like
val pairMin: Int = pair1.get().left
val pairMax: Int = pair1.get().right
```
