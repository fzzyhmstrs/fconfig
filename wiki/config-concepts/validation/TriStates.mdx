title: Validated TriStates
---

<Callout>
Added in Fzzy Config 0.6.5
</Callout>

Validation wrapping a Fzzy Config-specific `TriState` (also found in Fabric API, Minecraft itself, among many other places). Like most Tri-states it has three values, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `DEFAULT`.

Tri-states in Fzzy Config implement an interface `TriStateProvider` that includes helper methods useful for getting and interacting with a tri-state. `ValidatedTriState` also implements this interface and thus can be interacted with like it is a tri-state directly.

`ValidatedField` and `ValidatedCondition` now also include an overload of `toCondition`/`withCondition` that accepts a BooleanSupplier. `TriStateProvider`, conveniently, is a BooleanSupplier thus can be passed directly to another validation as a condition. `DEFAULT` will be treated as `FALSE` in this case.

```java !!tabs Java
public ValidatedTriState myTriState = new ValidatedTriState(TriState.TRUE);

public ValidatedTriState myTriState2 = new ValidatedTriState(TriState.TRUE, ValidatedTriState.WidgetType.CYCLING); //default widget has the three states side-by-side. A more classic MC cycling widget can also be used.

public TriState mySimpleTriState = TriState.TRUE; //simple fields also work, validation will be wrapped automatically like most types.
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
var myTriState = ValidatedTriState(TriState.TRUE)

var myTriState2 = ValidatedTriState(TriState.TRUE, ValidatedTriState.WidgetType.CYCLING) //default widget has the three states side-by-side. A more classic MC cycling widget can also be used.

var mySimpleTriState = TriState.TRUE //simple fields also work, validation will be wrapped automatically like most types.
```
