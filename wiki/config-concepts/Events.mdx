<Callout>
Added in Fzzy Config 0.5.0
</Callout>

Fzzy Config has an event system, with a series of methods in `Config` for managing events in your config, an `EventApi` for registering to generic config events, as well as a way to attach listeners to [Validation](Validation)

There are methods in `Config` that correspond to event stages. These are called alongside the events described below; if you only need to take action in your own config it's better to implement these than to register to the events, which are called for every config.

| Method           | Environment | Description                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onSyncClient`   | Client      | Called when a player logs in or data packs are reloaded                                                                           |
| `onSyncServer`   | Server      | Called when a player logs in or data packs are reloaded                                                                           | 
| `onUpdateClient` | Client      | Called after a config is updated in-game; when "apply changes" is used or the config GUI is closed, or when an update is received |
| `onUpdateServer` | Server      | Called when a update is synced to the server and it passes permission checks                                                      |

<Callout variant="info">
These methods are called on their respective main threads (Render/Server thread), so it is safe to interact with game state.

The `EventApi` manages registration to events in Fzzy Config. Call the Event API with `ConfigApi.event()`. The events in the API mirror the methods in `Config`, but are fired for every config relevant to the event. They also pass generic information (`Config` vs. the exact config subclass).

| Method           | Environment | Params                                                      | Description                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `onSyncServer`   | Server      | config ID: Identifier, config: Config                       | Fired when a player logs in or data packs are reloaded                                                                           |
| `onUpdateClient` | Client      | config ID: Identifier, config: Config                       | Fired after a config is updated in-game; when "apply changes" is used or the config GUI is closed, or when an update is received |
| `onUpdateServer` | Server      | config ID: Identifier, config: Config, player: ServerPlayer | Fired when a update is synced to the server and it passes permission checks                                                      |

The above events are called when an update is "officially" completed for the entire config. If you need to inspect changes to a setting under any circumstance, either a player change or an in-code change, you can attach a listener to a `ValidatedField`.

These listeners are `Consumer` of the field itself. There are two methods available for attachment:
* `addListener`, directly in `ValidatedField` itself. This has no return; you will have to attach in an init block.
* `withListener`, an extension function with `ValidatedField` as a receiver. This method passes the field through, allowing you to attach inline, it also preserves the typing of the field.

<Callout variant="warning">
These changes may be made on any thread, depending on the particulars of how the field is interacted with. Take precautions when interacting with game state.

```java !!tabs Java
// add listener is the direct approach to attaching a listener. It doesn't have a return nor does it preserve typing, so use of `withListener` is recommended
private static ValidatedBoolean helper() {
    ValidatedBoolean myBool = new ValidatedBoolean(false);
    myBool.addListener(myField -> do.stuff());
    return myBool;
}


ValidatedBoolean myListenedField = helper();

//with listener inlines the attachment more easily, and maintains the typing inside the consumer.
ValidatedBoolean myListenedBool = ValidatedField.withListener(new ValidatedBoolean(false), valBool -> do.stuff());
```

var myListenedField = ValidatedBoolean(false).also { it.addListener { valField: ValidatedField<Boolean> -> do.stuff() } }

//with listener inlines the attachment more easily, and maintains the typing inside the consumer.
val myListenedBool = ValidatedBoolean(false).withListener { valBool: ValidatedBoolean -> do.stuff() }
