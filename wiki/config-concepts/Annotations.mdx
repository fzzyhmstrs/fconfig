Augment the functionality of your configs with these annotations. The currently available list of annotations is:
* [`@ClientModifiable`](annotations/Client-Modifiable) - Marks setting as editable regardless of permissions
* [`@WithPerms`](annotations/With-Perms) - Defines the permission level needed to edit marked settings
* [`@WithCustomPerms` and `@AdminLevel`](annotations/With-Custom-Perms) - Defines permissions in LuckPerms/Forge Permissions API string-based style; optionally falling back to vanilla permissions.
* [`@NonSync`](annotations/Non-Sync) - Defines a field as client-only. Won't sync to/from servers and no permission checks
* [`@Version`](annotations/Version) - Sets the version of a config class, used for version-managed updates
* [~~`@RequiresRestart`~~](annotations/Requires-Restart) - (Deprecated as of 0.4.0) Prompts a user to restart after syncing
* [`@RequiresAction`](annotations/Requires-Action) - (As of 0.4.0) Alerts the user to a needed action if they change the affected setting. Applies to fields and classes.
* [`@ConvertFrom`](annotations/Convert-From) - Specifies an old config file to scrape and convert into a Fzzy Config toml
* [`@IgnoreVisibility`](annotations/Ignore-Visibility) - Marked classes can have fields/properties with lower visibility than public
* [`@Translation`](annotations/Translation) - Defines a custom lang prefix for a setting or whole config
* [`Toml Annotations`](annotations/Toml-Annotations) - Annotations for augmenting config .toml files.
