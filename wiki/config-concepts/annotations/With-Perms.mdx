title: "@WithPerms"
---

`@WithPerms` sets a special permission requirement for a setting. All configs have an overall required permission level, this individually modifies the perms of one setting. The overall perms can also be changed for a config. By default, they are permission level 2 (gamemaster).

```java !!tabs Java
// changing the permission levels of an entire config
public class MyConfig extends Config {
    //constructor goes here

    @Override
    public int defaultPermLevel() {
        return 4; // default is 2, this sets the default perm level to 4 (owner)
    }

    @WithPerms(opLevel = 2) // this field is ok to be perm level 2 still, specially set it
    public int mySpecialField = 2;
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
// changing the permission levels of an entire config
class MyConfig: Config(Identifier.of("my_id")) {
    
    override fun defaultPermLevel(): Int {
        return 4 // default is 2, this sets the default perm level to 4 (owner)
    }

    @WithPerms(2) // this field is ok to be perm level 2 still, specially set it
    var mySpecialField = 2
}
```
