title: Toml Annotations
---

TomlKt, the library that Fzzy Config's serializer is built off of, provides a series of annotations for decorating the .toml output files.
* `@Comment` / `@TomlComment` - Adds a comment to the output file. Also, if no description translation is provided, Fzzy Config will use this comment in the in-game tooltip.
* `@Inline` / `@TomlInline` - Forces the annotated list or map to be single-line in the output file.
* `@BlockArray` / `@TomlBlockArray` - Modifies the encoding process of corresponding array-like property, either to force array of table to be encoded as block array, or to change how many items should be encoded per line
* `@MultilineString` / `@TomlMultilineString` - Marks that the string property is multiline
* `@LiteralString` / `@TomlLiteralString` - Marks the annotated string property as a literal in the output file. This means it will have single quotes `'C:\Users\<User>\.m2\repositories'` and escaping won't be performed by the parser.
* `@Integer` / `@TomlInteger` - Defines the visual format of a integer-like numeric property (byte, short, int, long).
    * Base.Bin - binary `0b11010100`
    * Base.Oct - octal `0o81244`
    * Base.Dec - standard decimal form.
    * Base.Hex - hexidecimel `0xFF342B6A`
