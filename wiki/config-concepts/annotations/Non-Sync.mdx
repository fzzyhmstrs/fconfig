title: @NonSync
---

`@NonSync` excludes a field from server-client synchronization, and by extension removes and permission requirements (as the setting can't affect the server anyway). This is primarily useful for client-only settings. Before using this annotation, consider if you can have an entire client-sided config separate from any synced configs. See [New Configs - Config Registration](/config-design/New-Configs#3-config-registration) for details.
