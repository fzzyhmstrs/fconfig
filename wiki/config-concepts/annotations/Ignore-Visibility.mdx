title: "@IgnoreVisibility"
---

`@IgnoreVisiblity` tells the serializer that it should not ignore non-public fields. It will attempt to access widen private, protected, etc. fields and properties while performing de/serialization. This is useful if you want to make a config in a typical Java style, with private fields that have getters and setters as needed.

<Callout variant="info">
This can also be used on a <code>ConfigSection</code>, or a class wrapped by a <code>ValidatedAny</code>, to enable the class type to be less-than-public.
</Callout>

```java !!tabs Java
@IgnoreVisibility
public class ConfigImpl extends Config {
    public ConfigImpl {
        super(new Identifier("example", "config"));
    }

    private int myPrivateField = 0;

    @IgnoreVisibility
    private static class SecretBit { /* stuff goes here */ }

    // this ValidatedAny will work, thanks to the IgnoreVisibility on the SecretBit class. Otherwise the class would have to be public.
    // note that the IgnoreVisiblity of the SecretBit is not responsible for the mySecretBit visibiltity; that is handled by the ConfigImpl annotation
    private ValidatedAny<SecretBit> mySecretBit = new ValidatedAny(new SecretBit());
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
@IgnoreVisibility
class ConfigImpl: Config(Identifier.of("example", "config")) {
    
    private var myPrivateProperty = 0

    @IgnoreVisibility
    private class SecretBit { /* stuff goes here */ }

    // this ValidatedAny will work, thanks to the IgnoreVisibility on the SecretBit class. Otherwise the class would have to be public.
    // note that the IgnoreVisiblity of the SecretBit is not responsible for the mySecretBit visibiltity; that is handled by the ConfigImpl annotation
    private var mySecretBit = ValidatedAny(SecretBit())
}
```
