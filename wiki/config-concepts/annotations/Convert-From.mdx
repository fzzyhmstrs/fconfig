title: @ConvertFrom
---

`@ConvertFrom` provides the deserializer with the path and file name to a pre-existing config file from an old config library. The deserializer will do its best to scrape still-relevant data from the old file, and then discard it.

Supported file types:
* `.toml`
* `.json`
* `.json5`
* `.jsonc`

The below examples will read an old file `./minecraft/config/example/config.json` and attempt to scrape as much relevant data from it as possible by converting it to TOML first and then using that converted file as input to the deserializer.

```java !!tabs Java
@ConvertFrom(fileName = "config.json", folder = "example")
public class ConfigImpl extends Config {
    public ConfigImpl {
        super(new Identifier.of("example", "config"));
    }
    //config stuff go here
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
@ConvertFrom("config.json", "example")
class ConfigImpl: Config(Identifier.of("example", "config")) {
    //config stuff go here
}
```
