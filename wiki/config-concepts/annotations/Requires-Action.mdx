title: "@RequiresAction"
---

<Callout>
Added in Fzzy Config 0.4.0
</Callout>

`@RequiresAction` indicates that the user will need to take a certain action if a relevant field is changed in order for the change to take full effect. The actions are prioritized based on their Enum ordinal; you can annotate a class with a certain action, but upgrade certain settings with a separate annotation of higher priority.

The available actions, from highest to lowest priority
1. `RESTART`: Same action as ~~`@RequiresRestart`~~. Prompts that a restart is needed, and will disconnect clients joining a server with a synced RESTART, prompting them to restart their client after the sync to apply the changes.
2. `RELOG`: The user needs to disconnect and reconnect to their current world or server for changes to take effect.
3. `RELOAD_BOTH`: Both data packs and assets need to be reloaded.
4. `RELOAD_DATA`: Data packs need to be reloaded.
5. `RELOAD_RESOURCES`: Resource packs need to be reloaded.

```java !!tabs Java
@RequiresAction(action = Action.RESTART)
public int myItemDurability = 250; // something like item durability would require a restart, as durabilities are immutable once an item is instantiated.

@RequiresAction(action = Action.RELOAD_RESOURCES)
public Identifier guiTheme = Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "default_theme"); // some sort of reloadable theme selector, that needs to reload resources to apply the new theme.
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
@RequiresAction(Action.RESTART)
var myItemDurability = 250 // something like item durability would require a restart, as durabilities are immutable once an item is instantiated.

@RequiresAction(Action.RELOAD_RESOURCES)
var guiTheme = Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "default_theme") // some sort of reloadable theme selector, that needs to reload resources to apply the new theme.
```

</CodeTabs>

If `Action.RESTART` is used, a connecting client will see the same restart screen as shown with ~~`@RequiresRestart`~~
