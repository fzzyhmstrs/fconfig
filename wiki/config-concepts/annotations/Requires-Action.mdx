title: "@RequiresAction"
---

Introduced as of 0.4.0.

`@RequiresAction` indicates that the user will need to take a certain action if a marked field (or any field in a marked class) is changed, in order for the change to take full effect. The actions available are prioritized based on their Enum ordinal, so you can annotate a class with a certain action, but upgrade particular settings with a separate annotation of higher priority.

The available actions, from highest to lowest priority
1. `RESTART`: Same action as `@RequiresRestart`. Will prompt the user after a change that a restart is needed, and will disconnect clients joining a server with a synced RESTART change, prompting that they restart their client after the sync to apply the changes.
2. `RELOG`: Prompts the user that they need to disconnect and reconnect to their current world or server for changes to take effect.
3. `RELOAD_BOTH`: Prompts the user that both datapacks and assets need to be reloaded.
4. `RELOAD_DATA`: Prompts the user that datapacks need to be reloaded.
5. `RELOAD_RESOURCES`: Prompts the user that resource packs need to be reloaded.

```java !!tabs Java
@RequiresAction(action = Action.RESTART)
public int myItemDurability = 250; // something like item durability would require a restart, as durabilities are immutable once an item is instantiated.

@RequiresAction(action = Action.RELOAD_RESOURCES)
public Identifier guiTheme = Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "default_theme"); // some sort of reloadable theme selector, that needs to reload resources to apply the new theme.
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
@RequiresAction(Action.RESTART)
var myItemDurability = 250 // something like item durability would require a restart, as durabilities are immutable once an item is instantiated.

@RequiresAction(Action.RELOAD_RESOURCES)
var guiTheme = Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "default_theme") // some sort of reloadable theme selector, that needs to reload resources to apply the new theme.
```

</CodeTabs>

If `Action.RESTART` is used, a connecting client will be presented with the same restart screen as shown with `@RequiresRestart`
