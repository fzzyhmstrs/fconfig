title: Laying Out Configs
---

Proper layout of a config can make or break user and modder experience in and out of game. Determine the flow of your config settings, how they are or will be grouped into common themes, and create a layout matching expectations for navigation, maintenance, and use.

## 1. How Many Configs?
The first question to ask; how many config files will there be? For small mods, one config class will almost always be enough. For more complex mods, breaking configs into parts can be very beneficial.

<Callout>
This choice will also affect what the player sees when they open your 'root' config screen.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info">
Config registration can be separated into synced and non-synced (client-side) configs. If you have client-only settings, consider splitting your config and putting all client settings together into their own config(s)
</Callout>

### [Simple] One Config
For small mods or if you want to be quick about things, create one config class with all settings in one place. 
* _The screen will open to the config settings screen itself, with all options laid out in a list._
* _There will be one .toml file managing all stored data for your config._

Fzzy Config maintains the declaration order of settings when displaying them in-game. As such, best practice is to group similar setting together. This makes it easier for users to navigate the setting list in a sensible manner.

<Callout>
Don't worry about adding new setting 'in the middle' of a config class later. Fzzy Config will handle the new addition without a hiccup. Focus on keeping your settings organized as your config grows
</Callout>

### [Beyond] Two+ Configs
Fzzy Config makes organizing and partitioning your config settings easy. Create multiple config classes with the same namespace and they will be automatically grouped together in-game.
* _The main screen will be a 'config selector', with buttons leading to each individual config screen._
* _One .toml file will be generated per config class._

Similar settings should be grouped into configs together. A common user expectation is that configs are grouped by in-game 'elements'.
* One config per registry type: Items config, Blocks config, Enchantments config, etc.
* One config per major gameplay element: Crafting config, Loot config, Client settings, etc.
* Take advantage of class-wide annotations for a particular config like [`@WithPerms`](../config-concepts/annotations/With-Perms)/[`@WithCustomPerms`](/config-concepts/annotations/With-Custom-Perms)

Like single config layouts, items within a config class should be organized in a meaningful manner.

## 2. Organization
Large configs benefit from being broken up into parts, if separate config classes aren't suitable. Fzzy Config supports organization in three primary ways for two main purposes, sub-configuration and layout flow. Two of these methods also act as _anchors_ ([See below](#3-anchors)).

| Strategy              | UI Style                    | Repeatable | Anchor |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------|
| [Sections](#sections) | Opens new screen            | Yes        | Yes    |
| [Objects](#objects)   | Opens popup                 | Yes        | No     |
| [Groups](#groups)     | Collapsible inline grouping | No         | Yes    |

If you use a common subclass for creation of repeating sub-elements, consider using the [`@Translation`](../config-concepts/Translation) annotation, which will let you define common lang for all instances of the repeating element. 

### Sections
Sub-config classes can be extended from [`ConfigSection` ðŸ”—](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.config/-config-section). Sub-configs made this way will open a new, separate config screen of their own on top of the parent config screen.
* _Sections are recommended for large sections of a parent config that belong together, where separating them into individual configs completely might be laborious._
* _For example, if you have an `ItemsConfig`, you may have a `Swords` section, an `Axes` section, and so on._

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
public class ItemsConfig extends Config {

    public ItemsConfig() {
        super(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "items_config"));
    }

    //settings that apply to all items can go in the parent class

    public boolean overallItemSetting = true;
    public integer overallItemWeight = 10;

    // category-specific settings can go into sections

    public AxesSection axes = new AxesSection(); // axe settings are stored here
    public static class AxesSection extends ConfigSection { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Axe-specific settings go here */
    }

    public SwordsSection swords = new SwordsSection(); // axe settings are stored here
    public static class SwordsSection extends ConfigSection { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Sword-specific settings go here */
    }

    public TridentsSection tridents = new TridentsSection(); // axe settings are stored here
    public static class TridentsSection extends ConfigSection { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Trident-specific settings go here */
    }
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
class ItemsConfig: Config(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "items_config")) {

    //settings that apply to all items can go in the parent class

    var overallItemSetting = true
    var overallItemWeight = 10

    // category-specific settings can go into sections

    var axes = AxesSection() // axe settings are stored here
    class AxesSection: ConfigSection() { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Axe-specific settings go here */
    }

    var swords = SwordsSection() // axe settings are stored here
    class SwordsSection: ConfigSection() { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Sword-specific settings go here */
    }

    var tridents = TridentsSection() // axe settings are stored here
    class TridentsSection: ConfigSection() { // a Config Section. Self-serializable, and will add a "layer" to the GUI.
        /* Trident-specific settings go here */
    }
}
```

### Objects
[Validation](../config-concepts/Validation) is its own topic, but for the sake of this article, FzzyConfig supports arbitrary Simple Objects (POJO) with its validation engine. Validated Objects (called [`ValidatedAny` ðŸ”—](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.validation.misc/-validated-any) internally) will open a 'popup' window where the user can make selections.
* _Objects are recommended where you need small, repeating blocks of particular settings that the user may want to copy and paste between settings_
* _For example, if you have an `EntityConfig, you may have an object per entity that defines common settings like health, damage, movement speed, and so on._

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
public class BoisConfig extends Config {

    public BoisConfig() {
        super(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "bois_config"));
    }

    // If there are common clusters of settings you want to use in many places, such as mob stats,
    // you can use ValidatedAny to implement arrangements of settings from one common source
    // the empty constructor is needed for serialization
    public class BoiStats implements Walkable { //this doesn't have to implement Walkable, but it enables automatic validation

        public BoiStats() {
            this(20.0,5.0,0.3);
        }

        public BoiStats(double hp, double dmg, double spd) {
            this.health = hp;
            this.damage = dmg;
            this.speed = spd;
        }

        public double health;
        public double damage;
        public double speed;
    }

    //settings built from your generic boi stats object

    public ValidatedAny<BoiStats> bigBoi = new ValidatedAny(new BoiStats(40.0,8.0,0.15));

    public ValidatedAny<BoiStats> littleBoi = new ValidatedAny(new BoiStats(10.0,1.0,0.4));

    public ValidatedAny<BoiStats> regularBoi = new ValidatedAny(new BoiStats());

    // you don't need to use ValidatedAny! FzzyConfig knows to wrap objects with one internally if they implement Walkable
    public BoiStats plainBoi = new BoiStats();
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
class BoisConfig: Config(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "bois_config")) {

    // If there are common clusters of settings you want to use in many places, such as mob stats,
    // you can use ValidatedAny to implement arrangements of settings from one common source
    // the empty constructor is needed for serialization
    class BoiStats(hp: Double, dmg: Double, spd: Double): Walkable { //this doesn't *have* to implement Walkable, but it enables automatic validation

        constructor(): this(20.0, 5.0, 0.3) // empty constructor for serialization and validation

        var health = hp
        var damage = dmg
        var speed = spd
    }

    //settings built from your generic boi stats object

    var bigBoi = ValidatedAny(BoiStats(40.0,8.0,0.15))

    var littleBoi = ValidatedAny(BoiStats(10.0,1.0,0.4))

    var regularBoi = ValidatedAny(BoiStats())

    // you don't need to use ValidatedAny! FzzyConfig knows to wrap objects internally if they implement Walkable
    var plainBoi = BoiStats()
}
```

### Groups

<Callout>
Added in Fzzy Config 0.6.0
</Callout>

Groups are inline organization elements that don't _structurally_ change the config in-code. They are used for visual organization of information in a config GUI, and as an [anchor](#3-anchors) for quick navigation.

For example, say you have a Main config and a Client config. You may want to leave this structure alone without needing to call into specific subsections. In the client config there may be a section for GUI positions, another for sounds, another for particles. The user will be presented with three inline groups of settings that they can collapse out of the way if needed, and can still fast-navigate to with the Go-To menu.

Important group concepts
* Groups work like a stack; you push onto the stack by defining a `ConfigGroup` inline with where you want it to start
* To close a group, "Pop" it by annotating the last element you want in that group with `ConfigGroup.Pop`
* Groups nest; if you define multiple groups before popping any of them, you will get a nested subgroup.
* Pop for each push; not doing so will lead to undefined behavior. You can pop multiple groups on one setting, as many groups will end with that multi-popped field as annotations attached.

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
public ConfigGroup group1 = new ConfigGroup("test_group"); //"Pushes" a new group. Any settings added below this point will be included into the group until it is popped.

public Object groupSetting1 = TODO();
public Object groupSetting2 = TODO();
public Object groupSetting3 = TODO();
@ConfigGroup.Pop //pop the group to close it. Settings below this point won't be part of "test_group"
public Object groupSettingN = TODO();

public Object notInGroupSetting = TODO();
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
var group1 = ConfigGroup("test_group") //"Pushes" a new group. Any settings added below this point will be included into the group until it is popped.

var groupSetting1: Any = TODO()
var groupSetting2: Any = TODO()
var groupSetting3: Any = TODO()
@ConfigGroup.Pop //pop the group to close it. Settings below this point won't be part of "test_group"
var groupSettingN: Any = TODO()

var notInGroupSetting: Any = TODO()
```

</CodeTabs>

## 3. Anchors
Anchors are a concept introduced in Fzzy Config 0.6.0. Like anchors in webpages, anchors are "points of interest" that you can fast-navigate to in the config GUI. Back in [Organization](#2-organization), two of three anchors were introduced. The third is configs themselves.
* Configs
* Config Sections
* Groups

<Callout>
As noted above, `ValidatedAny` Objects are not anchors.
</Callout>

If your config is laid out with more than one anchor, a `Go To...` menu will be available in the bottom left (also accessible by pressing Ctrl + E). Clicking on any item in the resulting popup will bring the user to the screen and/or place in the screen where the anchor resides.

### Customizing anchors
Configs, sections, and groups all provide mechanisms for customizing anchors. In the example image below that all elements are using their predefined icon. You can customize this icon, as well as other things like the label. See the documentation for the specific element for information on editing the anchor info for it.
