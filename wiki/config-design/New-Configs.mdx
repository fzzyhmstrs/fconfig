title: New Configs
---

Creating a brand-new config system based on Fzzy Config? Let's get started! This guide will walk through the basic steps needed to get your config up and running.

## Steps
1. [Development of Config layout](#1-development-of-a-config-layout-)
2. [Config class(es) creation](#2-config-creation-)
3. [Config Registration](#3-config-registration-)
4. [Polish](#4-polish-)
5. [Integration into the Mod](#5-integration-into-your-mod-)

------------------------------------------

## 1. Development of a Config Layout <a href="#steps" style={{color: "#B2BFF9"}}>‚§¥</a>
Before you get into your Config implementation, figure out the layout you want (see article link below). This layout will determine how the configs are laid out visually, the user experience of navigating your settings, and how you interact with the config internally.

<Callout variant="warning">
This step is so important to all future uses of the config that I hesitate to say that there is a "quick and dirty" way to do it. Nevertheless, some mods only need a very simple config, so a very simple layout will do.
</Callout>

## 2. Config Creation <a href="#steps" style={{color: "#B2BFF9"}}>‚§¥</a>
With your layout in mind, create some config classes and fill them with the settings you need. Configs extend the base class `Config`.
1. Extend [`Config` üîó](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.config/-config/index), provide an Identifier, and any custom folder(s) as needed.
2. Fill in your empty class with settings. Settings have the following considerations:
    1. fields/properties need to be **non-final**, **non-static**, and **public**
    2. check out [Validation](../config-concepts/Validation) for more powerful setting configuration and choice-restriction options.

<Callout>
If you use the <code>IgnoreVisibility</code> annotation, you can set the visibility less than public (private, protected, etc).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning">
For Kotlin users, configs cannot be <code>object</code>, as they need to be instanced. You can have a separate Config object used internally throughout the mod that references an instance of the config class implementation
</Callout>

```java !!tabs Java
public class MyConfig extends Config {

    public MyConfig() {
        super(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "my_config"));
    }

    public double bareDouble = 5.0; // A double without validation. It will still have basic type-validation backing it internally.

    public boolean booleanThing = false; // most primitive types and a wide array of other types are supported by background validation. See Validation for details.

    public ValidatedDouble validatedDouble = new ValidatedDouble(5.0, 10.0, 0.0); //this field has defined validation, error correction, and will restrict user inputs to doubles between 0 and 10.

    public MySection mySection = new MySection(); // a section of the config with its own validated fields and other sections as applicable. This will appear in-game as a separate screen "layer" with a breadcrumb leading back to the parent screen.

    public static class MySection extends ConfigSection { // a Config Section. Self-serializable. Of course it doesn't have to be defined inside of it's parent class, but it may be convenient
        public MySection() {
            super();
        }

        public ValidatedBoolean sectionBoolean = ValidatedBoolean(true); //booleans can have defined validation, but it's not really necessary

        public ValidatedIdentifierMap<Double> sectionMap = ValidatedIdentifierMap( //validation exists for common collections too, maps, lists, sets, and so on
            new LinkedHashMap(), //empty default map
            ValidatedIdentifier.ofTag(Registries.ITEM.getId(Items.IRON_AXE), ItemTags.AXES), // the keys in this map can only be from the AXES tag
            new ValidatedDouble(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) //map values are double restricted between 0.0 and 1.0
        );
    }
	
	//Configs have a default permission level needed to edit them (disabled in single player). You can override that default here
	@Override
    public int defaultPermLevel() {
		return 4; 
    }
	
	//Fzzy Config uses TOML files by default. You can override that behavior to any of the supported FileType
	@Override
    public FileType fileType() {
		return FileType.JSON5;
    }
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
internal class MyConfig: Config(Identifier.of(MOD_ID, "my_config")) {

    var bareDouble = 5.0 // A double without validation. It will still have basic type-validation backing it internally.

    var booleanThing = false // most primitive types and a wide array of other types are supported by background validation. See Validation for details.

    var validatedDouble = ValidatedDouble(5.0, 10.0, 0.0) //this field has defined validation, error correction, and will restrict user inputs to doubles between 0 and 10.

    var mySection = MySection() // a section of the config with its own validated fields and other sections as applicable. This will appear in-game as a separate screen "layer" with a breadcrumb leading back to the parent screen.

    internal class MySection: ConfigSection() { // a Config Section. Self-serializable. Of course it doesn't have to be defined inside of it's parent class, but it may be convenient

        var sectionBoolean = ValidatedBoolean(true) //booleans can have defined validation, but it's not really necessary

        var sectionMap = ValidatedIdentifierMap( //validation exists for common collections too, maps, lists, sets, and so on
            mapOf(), //empty default map
            ValidatedIdentifier.ofTag(Registries.ITEM.getId(Items.IRON_AXE), ItemTags.AXES), // the keys in this map can only be from the AXES tag
            ValidatedDouble(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) //map values are double restricted between 0.0 and 1.0
        )
    }

    //Configs have a default permission level needed to edit them (disabled in single player). You can override that default here
    override defaultPermLevel(): Int {
       return 4
    }
    
    //Fzzy Config uses TOML files by default. You can override that behavior to any of the supported FileType
    override fileType(): FileType {
       return FileType.JSON5
    }
}
```

## 3. Config Registration <a href="#steps" style={{color: "#B2BFF9"}}>‚§¥</a>
Configs are accessed via an `INSTANCE` pattern. Access in this manner, with the API calls for registration and loading described below, prevents "too-early" access to a config that hasn't been populated with live data.
1. [`registerAndLoadConfig` üîó](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.api/-config-api/index.html#195300946%2FFunctions%2F769193423). The API call for registering and loading a config from file It will also automatically create the file if none exists. Select your [`RegisterType` üîó](https://fzzyhmstrs.github.io/fconfig/-fzzy%20-config/me.fzzyhmstrs.fzzy_config.api/-register-type/index) based on the user needs for the config settings
    1. `BOTH` - Default, will have a GUI client side, and will also auto-sync between servers and clients.
    2. `CLIENT` - Will only have GUI functionality, no syncing to/from servers.
    3. `SERVER` - No GUI, only auto-syncing between servers and clients (Not Recommended, the only way to edit these configs is directly the .toml).

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
class Configs {
    //instance of your config loaded from file and automatically registered to the SyncedConfigRegistry and ClientConfigRegistry using the getId() method
    //ConfigApiJava can come in handy to avoid pernicious compiler errors depending on your IDE and gradle setup.
    public static MyConfig myConfig = ConfigApiJava.registerAndLoadConfig(MyConfig::new);

    //adding the registerType, you can register a config as client-only. No syncing will occur. Useful for client-only mods.
    public static MyConfig myClientOnlyConfig = ConfigApiJava.registerAndLoadConfig(MyConfig::new, RegisterType.CLIENT);

    //adding the registerType, you can register a config as sync-only. Their won't be any client-side GUI functionality, so the config will only be editable from the file itself, but it will auto-sync with clients.
    public static MyConfig mySyncedOnlyConfig = ConfigApiJava.registerAndLoadConfig(MyConfig::new, RegisterType.SERVER);

    //Init function would be called in ModInitializer or some other entrypoint. Not strictly necessary if loading on-reference is ok.
    public static void init() {}
}
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
object Configs {
    //instance of your config loaded from file and automatically registered to the SyncedConfigRegistry and ClientConfigRegistry using the getId() method
    var myConfig = ConfigApi.registerAndLoadConfig(::MyConfig)

    //adding the registerType, you can register a config as client-only. No syncing will occur. Useful for client-only mods.
    var myClientOnlyConfig = ConfigApi.registerAndLoadConfig(::MyConfig, RegisterType.CLIENT)

    //adding the registerType, you can register a config as sync-only. Their won't be any client-side GUI functionality, so the config will only be editable from the file itself, but it will auto-sync with clients.
    var mySyncedOnlyConfig = ConfigApi.registerAndLoadConfig(::MyConfig, RegisterType.SERVER)

    //Init function would be called in ModInitializer or some other entrypoint. Not strictly necessary if loading on-reference is ok.
    fun init() {}
}
```

## 4. Polish <a href="#steps" style={{color: "#B2BFF9"}}>‚§¥</a>
Your basic config is complete, however you don't have to stop here! Read on to take your config to the next level! Or don't. Fzzy Config will work for you either way :).

### Validation
Already mentioned in step 2, Fzzy Config comes with a suite of validation tools. Among other features, these tools:
* Validate inputs and correct improper inputs
* Provide input restrictions
* Suggest inputs to users

Check out the options at:

[‚û°Ô∏è Validation](../config-concepts/Validation)

### Annotations
Fzzy Config has a variety of annotations that provide secondary functions a config author might need:
* Version Control
* Annotation-based validation for primitives
* Comments
* Server config permission control
* Various flags; client only, restart-triggering, and so on.

For the full breakdown check out:

[‚û°Ô∏è Annotations](../config-concepts/Annotations)

### Translation
Most config components are automatically translatable. You don't _have_ to translate anything, but you should. If you don't, Fzzy Config will do its best to generate human-readable names for you.

## 5. Integration into your Mod <a href="#steps" style={{color: "#B2BFF9"}}>‚§¥</a>
You've got a shiny, polished up config! How do you use it?
1. Simply call the fields as you normally would.
2. `ValidatedField` instances are suppliers, so call `.get()`.

<CodeTabs>

```java !!tabs Java
double myConfigDouble = Configs.myConfig.bareDouble; //plain fields are just plain fields. access them like normal!

boolean myConfigSectionValidated = Configs.myConfig.mySection.sectionBoolean.get(); //defined validation wraps your values in a Supplier. 
```

```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
val myConfigDouble = Configs.myConfig.bareDouble //plain fields are just plain fields. access them like normal!

val myConfigSectionValidated = Configs.myConfig.mySection.sectionBoolean.get() //defined validation wraps your values in a Supplier. 
```

```groovy !!tabs Groovy
double myConfigDouble = Configs.myConfig.bareDouble //plain fields are just plain fields. access them like normal!

boolean myConfigSectionValidated = Configs.myConfig.mySection.sectionBoolean.get() //defined validation wraps your values in a Supplier. 
```

```scala !!tabs Scala
val myConfigDouble = Configs.myConfig.bareDouble; //plain fields are just plain fields. access them like normal!

val myConfigSectionValidated = Configs.myConfig.mySection.sectionBoolean.get(); //defined validation wraps your values in a Supplier. 
```
