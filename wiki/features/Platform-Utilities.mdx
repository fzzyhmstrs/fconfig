title: Platform Utilities
---

As of 0.4.4, Fzzy Config has a lightweight `PlatformApi`, for performing common platform-specific functions without needing to write your own abstractions or having to rely on a separate API like Architectury.

More complex functions like registration are left to dedicated platform resources like Architectury.

### `isClient`
Checks whether the current game-state includes a logical client.

### `configDir`
Retrieves the current config directory as a `File`.

### `gameDir`
Retrieves the current root game directory as a `File`.

### `isModLoaded`
Checks whether the mod that uses the provided mod_id is loaded or not.

### `isDev`
Returns whether the current JRE is a development environment (`runClient` task etc.)

### `devlogger`
Creates a logger that only logs when the JRE is a development environment

### `testVersion`
Tests a provided string `modid` and `version` against the loaded version of that mod. If the mod isn't loaded or the comparison isn't valid, will return an empty optional.

## Registrar System
The registrar system is a currently experimental lightweight cross-platform registration system for Minecraft registries. Create a new registrar with `createRegistrar`.

See the [Registrar System](Registrar-System) page for specific usage information.
