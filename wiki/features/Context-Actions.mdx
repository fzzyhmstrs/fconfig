As of 0.6.0, there is a robust Context Handling system built into Fzzy Config. This system
* Captures key inputs with a custom keybind-like system
* Acts on inputs across "layered" context handling systems
* Opens actions in a right click menu where and when applicable

## The Foundation
The Context Action system, at its core, is a layered user-input handling technique. It was birthed from and inspired by techniques built into Minecraft itself:
* Keybinds
* Screen key and mouse input 
* Narration building

The vanilla keybind and screen input handling systems both have flaws that this context action system aims to address.
* Keybinds in vanilla overwrite each other if you double-map a keybind to the same key
* Keybinds can't have modifiers (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)
* To capture inputs on screens, you need to hardcode each interaction, properly ensuring execution order and so on. 
* Minecraft in general has no concept of context menus (right click menus)

### The `ContextType`
The first step in resolving these and other issues was unifying the input capture method. Why should screens not use keybinds just like... keybinds?

Enter `ContextType`. A ContextType is two things (unless it isn't, see below), an input listener and a `Map` key. The first is pretty self-explanatory. It accepts calls from a parent system and listens for relevant inputs. As a Map key, ContextType is used when building context menus for organization and ordering.

Any system can interact with ContextTypes in a unified manner. Be it keybind inputs from the keyboard, input codes from screen methods, or otherwise. Either mouse or keyboard input can be handled.

#### Example
```kotlin
//kotlin

//FC comes with a range of pre-defined common context types
ContextType.SAVE
ContextType.FIND
ContextType.COPY
ContextType.CONTEXT_KEYBOARD
//and so on. These can be used in handling without re-defining them. You should only redefine a type if you need the same input structure for a completely different user action result.

//new context types can be defined with the create method
val NEW = ContextType.create("new_file", ContextInput.KEYBOARD) { inputCode: Int, ctrl: Boolean, shift: Boolean, alt: Boolean ->
    inputCode == GLFW.GLFW_KEY_N && ctrl && !shift && !alt
}
```

```java
//java

//FC comes with a range of pre-defined common context types
ContextType.SAVE
ContextType.FIND
ContextType.COPY
ContextType.CONTEXT_KEYBOARD
//and so on. These can be used in handling without re-defining them. You should only redefine a type if you need the same input structure for a completely different user action result.

//new context types can be defined with the create method
ContextType NEW = ContextType.create("new_file", ContextInput.KEYBOARD,  (int inputCode, boolean ctrl, boolean shift, boolean alt) -> {
    inputCode == GLFW.GLFW_KEY_N && ctrl && !shift && !alt
});
```

### Now What?
Now that we have a universal input-capture system, what do we do with it? We handle the input of course! But before we get into that, we have to talk about layers *pause for Shrek onion joke*. The context type system can detect more than one relevant input for a given user input scenario. If the user pressed `Ctrl + Shift + Z`, we might have a `Ctrl + Shift + Z` and plain `Z` type returning as relevant. This is handled with a layered, event-like approach that passes information back and forth between layers

| Layer         | Purpose                                       | Direction     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Game Engine   | Handling in-game keybinds                     | Downstream ⬇️ |
| Screen        | Screen-wide context                           |               |
| List          | List actions, page up/down etc.               |               |
| List Element  | Individual element actions, clear, copy, etc. |               |
| Element Child | specialized actions                           | Upstream ⬆️   |

### The `ContextHandler`
The `ContextHandler` interface is designed to do just that, handle a passed context type. Any piece of your interaction puzzle that needs to manage inputs should implement this interface. 

Handling a received context input starts at the "head" of the applicable game layers and proceeds **downstream**. For a screen input, that would be at the screen layer. If the screen has a valid need for the passed type, it should handle it and pass back execution there. If it doesn't, pass handling to its child(ren). Rinse and repeat.

You end up with a downstream cascade, passing handling down as needed or returning back on success

| Layer         | Not Handled             | Handled        |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Screen        | Pass to List ⬇️         | Return true ↗️ |
| List          | Pass to List Element ⬇️ | Return true ↗️ |
| List Element  | Pass to Child ⬇️        | Return true ↗️ |
| Element Child | Return false ↗️         | Return true ↗️ |

#### Example
```kotlin
//kotlin
class Parent: ContextHandler {

    private val child = Child()

    //this handling prioritizes the parents actions over the childs, it can be refactored to care about the child first of course
    override fun handleContext(contextType: ContextType, position: Position): Boolean {
        return when(contextType) {
            ContextType.A -> handleContextA(position) //some parent-wide action
            ContextType.B -> handleContextB(position) //another parent-wide action
            else -> child.handleContext(contextType, position) //no applicable parent-wide handling, we move to the child
        }
    }
}

class Child: ContextHandler {

    //child handles whatever it needs, and then since it's the furthest downstream layer, returns false if it can't handle the input, per the flow diagram above.
    override fun handleContext(contextType: ContextType, position: Position): Boolean {

        //we can scope in the passed position to be relevant to this childs working position
        val newPosition = position.copy(x = this.x, y = this.y, width = this.width, height = this.height)

        //handle relevant context types, otherwise terminate the chain with failure since this is the last layer
        return when(contextType) {
            ContextType.C -> handleContextC(newPosition) //some child-specific action
            ContextType.D -> handleContextD(newPosition) //another another child-specific action
            else -> false // no further downstream layers, so we return a failure from here
        }
    }
}
```

### The Context Action
The class that names the whole system, `ContextAction`. Context Actions are not strictly necessary in the grand scheme of a Context Action system, but provide two key benefits for use:
* Provide a structured means of creating context callbacks for later use in a context handler. If you want to see an example of this in FC, you can explore how the `ConfigEntry` class handles context.
* Are used in context menus (right click menus), particularly with the `ContextProvider` framework (see below).

Outside of these two circumstances, it is generally valid to handle context "manually" inline with where the context handler is.

`ValidatedField` is the best example of building context handling using actions, paired with 'ConfigEntry' as the final consumer of the building.

```kotlin
//kotlin

//ValidatedField has a method contextActionBuilder which is used to build a context map. You can see the default implementation in ValidatedField itself to get a gist of the process, and in ValidatedList to see an example of layering actions.
override fun contextActionBuilder(context: EntryCreator.CreatorContext): MutableMap<String, MutableMap<ContextType, ContextAction.Builder>> {
    val map: MutableMap<ContextType, ContextAction.Builder> = mutableMapOf()
    val action = ContextAction.Builder("my.action.translation.key".translate()) {
            //code upon action being fired goes here
            true } //return true/false based on handling result
            .icon(MY_CUSTOM_CONTEXT_ICON) //a small icon can be passed here; it will appear in the context menu to the left of the action name.
            .active { /* predicate for when the action can be performed */ }

    map[MY_CONTEXT_TYPE] = action //add our action into a map using a ContextType as a key
    val map2 = super.contextActionBuilder(context) //getting the builder map from the base builder method
    map2[ContextResultBuilder.ENTRY].computeIfAbsent(key) { mutableMapOf() }.putAll(map) //apply the new action to the previously built ENTRY section, if any.
}
```

### Context Providers
The `ContextProvider` interface helps tie everything discussed above together. While the `ContextHandler` works downstream, ContextProvider works upstream, passing context information back up the chain for consumption by a further upstream handler. This achieves two major goals:
* Providing a mechanism for a context handler to request context actions from children without them needing to themselves be handlers.
* Building a structure for a context menu (right click menu)

Considering the context handler flow diagram above, we can see how a handler and provider could work together:

| Layer         | Downstream             | Upstream        |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Screen        | Pass to List ⬇️         | Return true ↗️ |
| List          | **Request context for menu** ⬇️ | Use builder to open context menu<br><br>Return true ↗️ |
| List Element  | Pass ContextBuilder ⬇️        | Append own actions<br><br>Builder ready for parent layer ⬆️ |
| Element Child | Add actions to builder ➡️         | Builder ready for parent layer ⬆️ |

Using the same context handling example from above, we'll add in a provider system

```kotlin
//kotlin
class Parent: ContextHandler, ContextProvider {

    private val child = Child()

    //this handling prioritizes the parents actions over the childs, it can be refactored to care about the child first of course
    override fun handleContext(contextType: ContextType, position: Position): Boolean {
        return when (contextType) {
            ContextType.A -> handleContextA(position) //some parent-wide action
            ContextType.B -> handleContextB(position) //another parent-wide action
            else -> { //handle other inputs with provided context actions
                val position = Position(/* Position information */) //create a position context for this element
                val contextBuilder = ContextProvider.empty(position) //create an empty context builder to pass downstream
                provideContext(contextBuilder) //build into the empty context
                when (contextType) { //act on the provided input type with the built actions
                    ContextType.CONTEXT_KEYBOARD, ContextType.CONTEXT_MOUSE -> { //context menu input (right click, Shift-F10, menu button)
                        openContextMenuPopup(contextBuilder) //open a context menu
                        true //return true, context handled
                    }
                    else -> { //some other so-far unhandled input
                        for (m in contextBuilder.apply()) { //build the context builder and iterate over the added entry groups
                            //if a matching input key is found in one of the groups, return its action application
                            return m[contextType]?.action?.apply(contextBuilder.position()) ?: continue
                        }
                        false //no applicable handling found, return final context handling failure
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // pass the request downstream first, build onto that last. This puts the most scoped-in contexts at the top of the context menu, and the most generalized actions at the bottom.
    override fun provideContext(builder: ContextResultBuilder) {
         child.provideContext(builder)
         builder.add("parent_group", PARENT_CONTEXT_TYPE, parentContextActionBuilder)
    }
}

class Child: ContextProvider {

    // child builds in its actions as needed
    override fun provideContext(builder: ContextResultBuilder) {
         builder.add("child_group", CHILD_CONTEXT_TYPE_A, builderA)
         builder.add("child_group", CHILD_CONTEXT_TYPE_B, builderB)
    }
}
```
