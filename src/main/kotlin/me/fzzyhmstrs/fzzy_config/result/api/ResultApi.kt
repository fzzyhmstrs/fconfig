     *
     * You can also supply _args_ via the scope string by appending them with a `?` like `mod_id.config_id.settingName?arg?arg2`. See the wiki for details on how this is or can be utilized.

     * @param fallback [Supplier]&lt;[T]&gt; - supplies a fallback value if the scope provided isn't valid. This fallback will be cached against any invalid scope, and an error logged, rather than an exception being thrown.
     * @param clazz [KClass]&lt;[T]&gt; - class type to provide. Scopes provided can point to either a direct instance of the type, or `validatedField<T>`. So Boolean and ValidatedBoolean are both valid targets for a Boolean provider.
