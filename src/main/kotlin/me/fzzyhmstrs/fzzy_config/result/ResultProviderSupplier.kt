     * - If the `thing` is a `ValidatedField` or otherwise a supplier of values, it can be used directly to provide a supplier of values
     * - If the `thing` is a basic primitive or object, the `property` should be used to supply values from the properties getter
     *
     * Using this general strategy ensures that fresh values are supplied on every call.
     * @param scope String representation of a config setting. See [the translation wiki page](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/fconfig/wiki/Translation) for an overview of how scopes work.
     * @param config [Config] the config instance providing results
     * @param thing [Any] the candidate result to potentially use to create the supplier with.
