### Additions
* Added `Supplier` overloads to `ConfigApi` to provide smoother interop with Java implementations, reducing the need for java mods to add fabric language kotlin to their compile class path.
* Added custom `validateAndSet` methods to `ValidatedIngredient` that allow for direct updating via Identifier, Set, or Tag without having to make your own Ingredient Provider instance first.

### Changes
* None.

### Fixes
