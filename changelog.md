* `Custom[Widgets]` are moved from the internal widget package to the custom package
* Several widgets and other classes have been deleted
* `PopupWidget` has many deprecations, and probably at least one breaking change despite my best efforts
* As of 0.6.3, `ActiveButtonWidget` is unused and deprecated, marked for removal by 0.7.0
* As of 0.6.3, `TextlessActionWidget` is unused and deprecated, marked for removal by 0.7.0
